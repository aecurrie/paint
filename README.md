# paint

Repo of my original art, use as you will (check the licence tho for physical printing, which has limitations because lots of these paintings have been sold as limited edition prints).

All the paintings are oil, most on canvas, then photographed either professionally (the v high def ones) or by me. Just because it's a painting doesn't mean you can't play around with the base image. Fork and change colours, make christmassy, use subsets, whatever. I do the same.

Cheers,
Anne
